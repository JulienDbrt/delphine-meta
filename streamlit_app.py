Son rapport √† la livraison : pas de bonne solution / sa consommation de colis : 20 colis/mois
La livraisons √† domicile: oui quand elle t√©l√©travaille mais cela reste contraignant : immobilisation, ins√©curit√©, produit perdu, pas discret sur des produits sensibles, faire rentrer quelqu‚Äôun chez soi‚Ä¶
Le point relais : s√©curis√© mais d√©pendance aux commerces (horaires, vacances, manque de fluidit√© dans l'actualisation de la disponibilit√© des points relais)
 Les lockers : lib√©rateurs de temps sur le principe mais parfois victimes de leurs succ√®s et pr√©sentant des limites au quotidien (difficile √† rep√©rer, acc√®s parfois limit√© lorsque l‚Äôimplantation d√©pend d‚Äôun lieu physique, places limit√©es)
 Le click & collecte : pratique dans l'id√©e mais parfois chronophage dans la r√©alit√© (commander, se d√©placer, subir les conditions r√©elles du shopping en magasin)
‚ÄúOn n‚Äôest pas forc√©ment press√©, √ßa peut-√™tre plus pratique sans √™tre rapide‚Äù

Son lien avec QOMOD
pas encore cliente, elle en a entendu parl√© par Flore.
Ce qu‚Äôelle a compris c‚Äôest que c‚Äôest pratique mais elle n‚Äôest pas certaine de comprendre tout ce que fait QOMOD. Toutefois sur l‚Äô√©change qu‚Äôelle a eu avec Flore, elle comprend que

‚ÄúL‚Äôid√©e est g√©niale, je trouve √ßa hyper int√©ressant, pas besoin d‚Äôaller √† 40 endroits pour r√©cup√©rer ses colis, parce que des fois, les sites o√π on commande, ce n'est pas tous les m√™mes points relais. √áa m‚Äôest arriv√© d‚Äôaller r√©cup√©rer dans un point relais qui est l√† bas, et l‚Äôautre ailleurs, et aujourd‚Äôhui on cherche √† gagner du temps et moins se prendre la t√™te, surtout avec mon agenda. C‚Äôest compliqu√© de devoir aller courir partout‚Äù
Le fait que cela soit le colis qui m‚Äôattende et pas l‚Äôinverse, c‚Äôest cool
Enfin, si en √©tant abonn√© je peux commander sur toutes les plateformes et me faire livrer au m√™me endroit, √ßa donne envie et c‚Äôest plus safe

D‚Äôautre part, elle √©met quelques freins √† son utilisation
‚ÄúEst-ce que c‚Äôest la mort des petits commer√ßants ?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSi pas d'interaction sociale c‚Äôest bof‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai peur de que cela soit assez impersonnel et je n‚Äôai pas besoin et je pr√©f√®re aller voir le fleuriste et le cordonnier et discuter avec eux‚Äù
 QOMOD on dirait un fourre tout de services, c‚Äôest quoi au final une conciergerie ?


Son avis sur le communication de QOMOD est assez tranch√©, c‚Äôest son m√©tier ! Elle trouve que la Com de QOMOD est moyenne vu qu‚Äôelle n'en a pas entendu parl√© directement. 
‚ÄúLa strat√©gie de communication doit √™tre essentielle pour frapper fort et √™tre vu comme un v√©ritable r√©seau de proximit√©‚Äù
